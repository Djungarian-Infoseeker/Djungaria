ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my personal space!

From a young age, I developed a profound love for the natural sciences and became deeply interested in many disciplines. Therefore, I hope to write an article as a summary of my past days and also to look forward to my future research plans.Due to my family purchasing a considerable amount of popular science books for me from a young age, I displayed a strong interest in astronomy and biology during my kindergarten years.
