From a young age, I developed a profound love for the natural sciences and became deeply interested in many disciplines. Therefore, I hope to write an article as a summary of my past days and also to look forward to my future research plans.Due to my family purchasing a considerable amount of popular science books for me from a young age, I displayed a strong interest in astronomy and biology during my kindergarten years. Next, I will start discussing astronomy.
## Astronomy
Although for a kindergarten child, the so-called interest in astronomy might not seem like astronomy in the academic sense. However, as time goes by, I increasingly feel that the preferences formed in early life can influence one's entire life. I once did not understand why so many busy scientists were willing to stoop down and engage in popular science activities with children. Now, I understand that these initial curiosities will plant the seeds of dreams for the next generation, sprouting at seemingly unexpected moments.
My earliest memory related to astronomy dates back to around when I was three years old (2005), playing on the computer in my father's office. I was fussing to have his help me search for 'the nine planets' on Baidu (Note: 1. At that time, Pluto had not yet been excluded from the list of planets. 2. I was too young to type then), so that I could view the images by clicking the mouse myself.
